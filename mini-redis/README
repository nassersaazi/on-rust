## Learn `tokio` by building a mini-redis implementation following (this tutorial)[https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/setup]

Plan: Do a blog post after completion on Lessons learned

Concurrency and parallelism are not the same thing. If you alternate between two tasks, then you are working on both tasks concurrently, but not in parallel. For it to qualify as parallel, you would need two people, one dedicated to each task. | One of the advantages of using Tokio is that asynchronous code allows you to work on many tasks concurrently, without having to work on them in parallel using ordinary threads. In fact, Tokio can run many tasks concurrently on a single thread!
